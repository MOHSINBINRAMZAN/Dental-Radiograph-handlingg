Dental Radiograph Handling Project! This repository contains all the necessary files and documentation to develop a machine learning model that can analyze dental radiographs and predict various dental issues such as cavities, periodontal disease, and other anomalies.

Features
Data Preprocessing: Scripts and tools to preprocess dental radiograph images, including resizing, normalization, and augmentation.
Model Training: Implementation of various machine learning models (e.g., convolutional neural networks) for dental issue detection.
Evaluation: Tools to evaluate model performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.
Visualization: Methods to visualize predictions on radiographs, including bounding boxes around detected cavities and heatmaps for regions of interest.
Deployment: Instructions and scripts for deploying the model to a production environment.
